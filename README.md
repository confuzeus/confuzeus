## whoami üßî

I'm Josh Michael Karamuth from [Mauritius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius).

## What you'll find üé•

I have many open source repos for you to dig into.

My main tech stack is Python with Django.

For Javascript I mostly use plain JS or sometimes jQuery. I like React as well, if you have one and are looking for contributors, email me ASAP.

CSS is written in SCSS and my UI framework of choice is Bootstrap.

### In Progress üìã

[django-getin](https://github.com/confuzeus/django-getin)

This is a Django app that allows you to build invite only
web apps.

It's mostly done but I haven't completed the documentation yet.

---

[mailiness](https://github.com/confuzeus/mailiness)

A Python CLI app I built for managing my self hosted email server.

It supports CRUD against the virtual mail database and generation of
DKIM keys.

### Released ‚úÖ

[django-allcaptcha](https://github.com/confuzeus/django-allcaptcha)

Adding captcha to your web forms is a great way to prevent spam but
this requires a lot of boilerplate.

That's why I made this simple Django app that allows you to easily
plug HCaptcha or ReCaptcha in your Django forms.

---

[ansible-plausible](https://github.com/confuzeus/ansible-plausible)

I use [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) for all my analytics
needs. They have a paid subscription but I prefer to self host.

That's why I made this simple Ansible bundle that allows you to
simply point it at your server and get a Plausible instance running
in minutes.

---

[simple-django](https://github.com/confuzeus/simple-django)

My simple Django project template.

This one allows you to quickly start hacking on a new
project idea using Django.

It has some best practices baked in with some of personal my
preferences as well.

Since this is my personal template, I experiment on it quite
a lot and don't care about backwards compatibility.

---

[cuiq-api](https://github.com/confuzeus/cuiq-api)

Sometimes you want to quickly setup a production
ready API without having to pull in a ton of 3rd
party packages.

This is my personal template for spinning a Flask based
API in seconds.

---

[simple-hugo](https://github.com/confuzeus/simple-hugo)

Ship high quality Hugo based websites quickly with starter kit.

## Abandoned ü§ï

[sasaas](https://github.com/confuzeus/sasaas)

This was supposed to be a SaaS project template but
while coding it, I realized that SaaS project requirements
vary quite a bit so a boilerplate doesn't make sense.

If your project is so simple that a boilerplate makes
total sense, then you should look at the popular No-code
tools like Bubble instead of investing on a custom coded app.

## Open source contributions üßë‚Äçüíª

[wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail)

Wagtail is my favorite CMS and thus, my project of choice
to contribute to in my spare time.

So far, I commited bug fixes and the *remember me* functionality
in the login form.
